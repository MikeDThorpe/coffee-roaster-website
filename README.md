# Coffee Roasters Multi-page website

A multi-page website built using React.js and Sass for a coffe subscription service. The designs for this website were provided in a sketch file from frontendmentor.io which i imported in Adobe XD to create the project from. 

This was a premium challenge from frontendmentor.io that required the website according to the design with specific designs created for mobile, tablet and desktop screens. This website is completely responsive. There's also the start of a subscription function that lets the user select a specific order for their subscription and proceed to a checkout.
